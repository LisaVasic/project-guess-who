# Project Guess Who

The assignment was to create a digital version of the board game Guess Who.

## The problem

I spent a lot of time to figure out the code and how everything was connected. Taking what I have learned from this weeks lessons and apply it to the code was tricky and I tried and failed a lot before making it work. It was a great feeling when the game was up and working :)
